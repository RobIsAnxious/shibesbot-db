# shibesbot-db

This is the repo the [@shibesbot](http://twitter.com/shibesbot) Twitter account pulls dog pictures from, woof. If you'd like to contribute, submit a pull request. 

Make sure that:
 * You add the picture to the  `pictures` directory.
 * The picture is at the highest resolution possible
 * It's actually a Shiba Inu 
 * ~~It hasn't been submitted before (because I'm too lazy to check)~~ I probably have plenty of duplicates here

If your PR gets accepted, the bot will post your photo (eventually).

If you're not sure how to submit a pull request, [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) should help :).
